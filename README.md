# Self-Destructing USB – Log-Based Intrusion Detection & Forensic Analysis  

## Description  

This project explores a proactive cybersecurity solution: a **Self-Destructing USB Process** that logs unauthorized access attempts and executes a secure data wipe if connected to an untrusted device. By integrating log-based intrusion detection and forensic analysis, the project enhances USB security, mitigating the risk of unauthorized data extraction and cyber threats.  

## Core Cybersecurity Principles  

- **Confidentiality** – Ensuring sensitive data on the USB remains inaccessible to unauthorized users.  
- **Integrity** – Preventing unauthorized modifications to stored data and logs.  
- **Availability** – Implementing controlled access mechanisms to ensure legitimate users can utilize the USB securely.  

## Technical Background  

The project applies principles of networking, cryptography, and security to detect unauthorized system access and trigger protective actions. Key areas of research included:  

- **Log-based intrusion detection** – Monitoring USB insertion logs and system details to detect anomalies.  
- **Self-destruction mechanisms** – Securely wiping data if unauthorized access is detected.  
- **Forensic analysis** – Capturing key information (e.g., timestamps, system details, attempted actions) for investigation.  

## Research & Development Steps  

1. **Threat Analysis** – Identifying common USB-based attack vectors.  
2. **Security Design** – Developing a log-based detection system and self-destruction criteria.  
3. **Implementation** – Writing scripts to automate detection, logging, and secure wiping.  
4. **Testing & Validation** – Simulating attack scenarios to evaluate system effectiveness.  
5. **Mitigation Strategies** – Providing recommendations for USB security best practices.  

## Live Demonstration  

The project includes a live demonstration showcasing the detection and self-destruction process in action. The key focus areas are:  

- Identifying unauthorized system access.  
- Logging details of an untrusted environment.  
- Executing data-wiping procedures securely.  

## Impacts & Security Enhancements  

By implementing this **Self-Destructing USB**, organizations and individuals can:  

- **Prevent Data Theft** – Attackers cannot extract sensitive data even if they gain physical access to the USB.  
- **Detect Unauthorized Use** – Logs provide forensic evidence for incident response.  
- **Enhance Endpoint Security** – Organizations can integrate similar mechanisms into enterprise USB security policies.  

## Mitigation: Securing USB Devices  

To prevent USB-based attacks, it is essential to:  

- Disable auto-run functionality on endpoints.  
- Use encrypted USBs with authentication mechanisms.  
- Regularly monitor USB access logs for anomalies.  
- Implement strict access control policies for removable devices.  

## Final Thought  

This project demonstrates a novel approach to USB security by integrating **log-based intrusion detection and automated self-destruction**. By applying these techniques, users can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data theft.
